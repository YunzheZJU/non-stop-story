Non-stop-story is a public API server project for VTuber live streams, which offers a stabled and reliable data source. 

It gathers various live infos from 'worker's and manages the interaction with a persistent database for developers.

RESTful API is now available at [HOLO.DEV](https://holo.dev/):
```
/api/v1/lives/current
/api/v1/lives/scheduled
/api/v1/lives/ended
/api/v1/live/1
/api/v1/members
/api/v1/channels
/api/v1/platforms
/api/v1/rooms
```

GraphQL API is available at:
```
/graphql
```

You can also have a try the friendly GUI [here](https://holo.dev/graphql).
